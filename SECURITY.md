# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the latest code in this repository.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` / latest | Yes |
| Older releases | Best effort only |

If you are running an older version, upgrade to the latest `main` state or
latest release before reporting security issues when possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these private channels:
1. Preferred: GitHub private vulnerability reporting / Security Advisories.
2. Fallback: email `security@darkatek7.com`.

When reporting, include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Affected version/commit and deployment context
- Any suggested fix or mitigation (if available)

## Response Expectations

Our target response windows:
1. Acknowledgement within 72 hours
2. Initial triage/update within 7 days
3. Coordinated disclosure after a fix or mitigation is available

Complex issues may take longer, but we will provide status updates throughout
triage and remediation.

## Disclosure Policy

- Do not publicly disclose exploit details before a patch or mitigation is
  available.
- We prefer coordinated disclosure that protects users while preserving proper
  credit for reporters.
- After remediation, we may publish a summary advisory describing impact,
  affected versions, and upgrade steps.
